야 시작이다. 야~야야야야~~ 손뼉치며 야~~야 야 야야~~!!
This application is 현대걸 사랑해 a starter template for building real-time web apps. It's running on a
Python [aiohttp]("http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/") server. The above "Server Ticks"
timestamps are sent from the server and subscribed to using the
[EventSource]("https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/EventSource") API.

`aiohttp` is an asynchronous web framework that exposes client and server APIs
letting you easily develop HTTP applications with persistent connections. It runs
on the `asyncio` event loop which encourages clean, readable code (no threads, no callbacks).
Its features include:

- pluggable routing and middlewares
- websockets
- file upload support
- a growing library of tools: [aio-libs](https://github.com/aio-libs/)
